# Reefy

**A premium tvOS Jellyfin client — one price, yours forever.**

---

## What is Reefy?

Reefy is a native Jellyfin client built **exclusively for Apple TV**. Unlike other clients that try to be everything everywhere, Reefy focuses on one thing: making your Apple TV the best way to watch your media server.

Born from a fork of Swiftfin, Reefy has been completely reimagined for the tvOS experience — no iOS compromises, no cross-platform baggage. Just pure Apple TV goodness.

## What's Been Built

Since December 2024, Reefy has undergone a complete transformation:

| Area | What Changed |
|------|--------------|
| **Focus** | Dropped iOS entirely — tvOS-only |
| **Player** | Complete redesign of playback controls with native tvOS feel |
| **Visuals** | tvOS 18 Liquid Glass effects with graceful fallback |
| **Stability** | Fixed critical memory leaks, race conditions, and crashes |
| **Navigation** | Rewrote focus engine for smooth remote navigation |
| **Modern** | Swift 6 ready, Xcode 16.4 compatible |

### The Numbers

- **750+ commits** of active development
- **100+ hours** of focused engineering time
- **Countless bugs squashed**

## The Math

Building quality software has real costs.

| Cost | Annual |
|------|--------|
| Apple Developer Program | $99 |
| TestFlight distribution | Included |
| **Engineering time** | **100+ hours/year** |

At $8.99 per copy:

- **89 sales** → covers the Apple Developer fee for one year
- **1,000 sales** → validates continued development
- **10,000 sales** → funds major features and faster updates

Every purchase directly supports ongoing work.

## Why $8.99?

Less than a movie ticket. Less than a month of any streaming service. One price, forever.

You've already invested in your media server. Invest in the best way to watch it.
